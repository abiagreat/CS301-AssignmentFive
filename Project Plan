Assignment 5 Project Plan

Test cases: 
We tested every possible the program in terms of the files and how the characters placed in the stack in 
the first and second file.


Expectations: 
We expect to have the program to open a file and read its contents into a stack of characters.
The program will pop the characters from the stack and 
save them in a second text file. The order of the characters will be saved in the second file 
and will reverse their order. 
We expect that each function will run successfully and that each test will pass.
